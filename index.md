# ORMGP Hydrograph Explorer Help

This document provides Help and a quick reference for the Hydrograph Explorer from ORMGP

# What is the Hydrograph Explorer Tool?

The [ORMGP Hydrograph Explorer](http://shiny.oakridgeswater.ca:3838/sHydrologyMap/) is a mapping tool where the Oak Ridges Moraine area has been divided into subwatersheds, each covering an area of approximately 10 square kilometres.

A _watershed_ is defined as an area of land where all water drains to a particular water body (e.g., lake, river segment).  A _subwatershed_ is a portion of a watershed where water drains to a smaller water body within the larger watershed. Each of the subwatersheds shown in this tool is located within larger subwatersheds and watersheds.  

Upon opening the [Hydrograph Explorer](http://shiny.oakridgeswater.ca:3838/sHydrologyMap/) the interactive map shows the entire ORMGP area, with discrete subwatersheds colour-coded based on percentage of impervious land cover. Using the menu in the upper-right corner, the user can select other options for the colour of the watersheds: 
- Imperviousness
- Canopy coverage 
- Wetland coverage 
- Open water coverage 
- Permeability 

In _Figure 1_, the imperviousness is colour-coded for each subwatershed.  Darker blue subwatersheds are more impervious, whereas lighter colours are more permeable.

The interactive mapping tool also provides properties of each subwatershed selected by the user.  When a subwatershed is selected by mouse-clicking on the map), the properties of the selected subwatershed appear in a window. These properties include:
- area of subwatershed
- permeability
- percent impervious cover
- percent canopy cover
- percent open water cover 
- percent wetland cover

In _Figure 2_, the map is zoomed in to see the individual subwatershed boundaries in more detail. Properties of the selected subwatershed are shown in a pop-up.
