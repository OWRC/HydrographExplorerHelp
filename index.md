# ORMGP Hydrograph Explorer Help

This document provides Help and a quick reference for the Hydrograph Explorer from ORMGP. 

# What is the Hydrograph Explorer Tool?

The [ORMGP Hydrograph Explorer](http://shiny.oakridgeswater.ca:3838/sHydrologyMap/){:target="_blank"} is a set of graphing and interpretation tools that allow users to examine hydrologic and hydrogeologic data within the Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM) study area. The tools can be used to view X-Y plots of water-level data for groundwater and surface-water locations.  Data sources include the ORMGP database and various online sources. 

Upon opening the [Hydrograph Explorer](http://shiny.oakridgeswater.ca:3838/sHydrologyMap/){:target="_blank"}, the user will see a basemap with an options menu on the right-hand side, as shown in _Figure 1_, below.

Users can select the date envelope in the upper-right, in the menue. The minimum and maximum data are selected with the slider bar.  Once the min and max dates are selected, the map will refresh with locations that include data from within the date envelope. There's also an option to select the minimum period of data.  Selecting 10 years (for example) from the dropdown menu will show locations that include at least 10 years of data. These two features are shown in Figure 2 below:

The menu on the right side also shows the types of locations that are available. Four data options are available:
- Streamflow stations
- Climate stations 
- Deep (>20 m) groundwater monitoring locations 
- Shallow groundwater monitoring locations

By default, locations with deep (>20 m below ground surface) groundwater monitoring data for the period 1992 - 2022 are shown. The four data types listed above can be shown alone or combined. 

The lowermost item on the menu provides a preview of the hydrograph for the selected location.

On the map, the user can zoom in to focus on a specific area using the roller on the mouse, or by clicking the + icon in the upper left corner of the map. Location names are shown when the user uses the mouse to hover over a specific location. 

Clicking on a location Will provide the full location name, plus an option to _analyze monitoring data_, as shown in the figure below:
