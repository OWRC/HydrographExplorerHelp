# ORMGP Hydrograph Explorer Help

This document provides Help and a quick reference for the Hydrograph Explorer from ORMGP

# What is the Hydrograph Explorer Tool?

The [ORMGP Hydrograph Explorer](http://shiny.oakridgeswater.ca:3838/sHydrologyMap/) is a set of mapping, graphing and interpretation tools that allow users to examine hydrologic and hydrogeologic data within the Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM) study area.

Upon opening the [Hydrograph Explorer](http://shiny.oakridgeswater.ca:3838/sHydrologyMap/), the user will see a basemap with an options menu on the right-hand side, as shown in _Figure 1_. The menu on the right side shows the options available. Four data options are available:
- Streamflow stations
- Climate stations 
- Deep (>20 m) groundwater monitoring locations 
- Shallow groundwater monitoring locations
By default, locations with deep (>20 m below ground surface) groundwater monitoring data for the period 1992 - 20022 are shown.

In _Figure 2_, the map is zoomed in to see the individual subwatershed boundaries in more detail. Properties of the selected subwatershed are shown in a pop-up.
