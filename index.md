# ORMGP Hydrograph Explorer Help

This document provides Help and a quick reference for the Hydrograph Explorer from ORMGP

# What is the Hydrograph Explorer Tool?

The [ORMGP Hydrograph Explorer](http://shiny.oakridgeswater.ca:3838/sHydrologyMap/) is a set of mapping, graphing and interpretation tools that allow users to examine hydrologic and hydrogeologic data within the Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM) study area.

Upon opening the [Hydrograph Explorer](http://shiny.oakridgeswater.ca:3838/sHydrologyMap/), the user will see a basemap of the ORM  he interactive map shows the entire ORMGP area, with discrete subwatersheds colour-coded based on percentage of impervious land cover. Using the menu in the upper-right corner, the user can select other options for the colour of the watersheds: 
- Imperviousness
- Canopy coverage 
- Wetland coverage 
- Open water coverage 
- Permeability 

In _Figure 1_, the imperviousness is colour-coded for each subwatershed.  Darker blue subwatersheds are more impervious, whereas lighter colours are more permeable.

The interactive mapping tool also provides properties of each subwatershed selected by the user.  When a subwatershed is selected by mouse-clicking on the map), the properties of the selected subwatershed appear in a window. These properties include:
- area of subwatershed
- permeability
- percent impervious cover
- percent canopy cover
- percent open water cover 
- percent wetland cover

In _Figure 2_, the map is zoomed in to see the individual subwatershed boundaries in more detail. Properties of the selected subwatershed are shown in a pop-up.
